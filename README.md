Hopefuly me or someone makes documentation, though the usage should not be that much different from pygame

example code can be found in `test.c`, though it will periodically be changed based on the stuff I'm working at.

There are also build scripts (for windows only, arch script will be added soon ) `build.bat` to build and run `test.c`.
There is also `lib.bat` used to build the library, which will be then located in `./buildlib/`.

Disclaimer: 
* This is NOT official port of pygame for c!
* This library/framework depends on SDL2 to work properly.
